      <b>May 6, 2023:</b> The day fate brought Mari and Tim together for their first date. It was a magical 12 hours where time seemed to stand still. Despite Tim's tendency to talk a lot, Mari couldn't help but be charmed.

      <b>June 17, 2023:</b> Tim asked Mari to be his girlfriend, and with a joyful heart, she said yes! Their love grew, and so did Tim's appetite. He humorously admits to gaining 30 lbs, but to Mari, it just means there's more of him to love.

      Tim has his quirks: repeating himself, forgetting things, and some funny bad manners, but Mari finds these endearing. Despite her occasional unreasonableness, Tim's patience never wavers.
      Tim shared that his life before Mari was like being on autopilot, doing things because he "should." But meeting Mari gave his life a new purpose. He shifted from "should" to "want" and "do.

      Through their love, Tim discovered what it truly means to love and be loved. Mari learned that while Tim might lack some common sense, his heart and dedication more than make up for it.
      They are incredibly excited to grow old together, cherishing every moment and looking forward to a beautiful future.
